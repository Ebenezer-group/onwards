Feel free to use the software in your projects.  However,
two of the files, quicklz.h and quicklz.c, are from another
developer and should only be used in conjunction with the rest
of the software here.  See http://quicklz.com for more info.

Building
There should be two makefiles here: one for BSD/Linux and one
for Windows.  The BSD version is called "makefile" and the
Windows version is called "makefile.windows".  If you're using
Windows, you may want to remove the BSD version and rename
makefile.mcr to just makefile.  If you're using a big-endian
machine, add -DCMW_ENDIAN_BIG to the CXXFLAGS in the makefile.

A library and two programs are built.
The programs are the C++ Middleware Writer Ambassador
(CMWA) and a command line interface which is called direct.
On Windows the CMWA program is not built.


Accounts
An account is needed to use the C++ Middleware Writer.
Before running the programs, you have to get an account
and modify your cmwAmbassador.cfg file to include your
account number(s) and password(s).


Running the CMW Ambassador (after installing):

cmwAmbassador cmwAmbassador.cfg

After starting the CMW Ambassador, run the direct
program like this:

direct 14 /home/brian/onwards/tiers/ambassador.req

or on Windows:

.\direct.exe 14 /Users/brian/onwards/tiers/ambassador.req

14 is an account number.  Substitute your account number there.

The path for a .req file is next -- req is short for request.
Zero or more header files and one "Middle file" are listed in
a .req file to specify a request.  There's more info on
Middle files here -- http://webEbenezer.net/middle.html.
A .req file also has the settings for various options.

Once you have built the software, I suggest copying
example.req and example.mdl to one of your directories
and modifying the copies according to your needs.


Troubleshooting
The middle tier has to be running for the front tier to work.
If direct fails with "No reply received.  Is the CMWA running?"
make sure the middle tier is running.

Another possible problem could be due to "breaking changes"
between the back and middle tier.  (We may have changed
the protocol between these tiers and now older versions
of the middle tier no longer work right.)  The thing to do
in this case is to check our website for an announcement
that you may have missed about this.  Probably you will
have to clone/download the new version of the repository
and then reinstall in order to fix the problem.

If you rename include files listed in one of your .req files, 
you should also touch that file so the change will be 
"noticed" by the CMW.


Thank you for using the software.
