These example programs don't require a C++ Middleware Writer
account in order to run them.  They also don't require a
C++ 2017 compiler.  They are built with -std=c++11.

To build the examples run

make example

from the onwards directory.  Or

make example -C ..

from the example subdirectory.

It helps to have two command prompts available to run the
examples.  Start the receiveExample program prior to running
sendExample.
