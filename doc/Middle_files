Middle files are used to specify what messaging and
serialization code the C++ Middleware Writer should output.

Lines like the following are the basis of Middle code:
[ options ] (T1, T2, ...  Tn)

Options start with a dash (-) symbol. After any options, a list of
C++ types is enclosed in a pair of parentheses.  One or more of
these lines are wrapped by a name and a closing brace like this:

sendMessages
    -out (message_id_8, ::std::vector<int32_t>, ::std::string)
    -out (message_id_8, ::std::array<float,3>)
    -out (message_id_8, ::plf::colony<::std::string>)
}

Based on that input, the C++ Middleware Writer (CMW) creates a
sendMessages namespace in a file called zz.sendMessages.hh.
Functions are created within the namespace for each of the lines
with matching parentheses.

These are the available options:
 -out, -in, -noInline, -maxLength, -yeaNay

The out and in options are used to tailor the output.  If you
specify only -out, only the message-building/sending function is
generated.  If you specify only -in, only the message-parsing/
receiving function gets generated.

The noInline option indicates that a generated function should
not be marked as inline.  If you only include a generated header
in one translation unit, it's safe to use noInline.  This option
may help reduce the size of your executables.

The maxLength option allows users to specify the maximum length
for a message.  If the length of the message exceeds the value
specified, an exception will be thrown. If this option isn't used,
the CMW supplies a default value of 10,000.  Here's an example of
how to use this option:
  -maxLength=cmw::udp_packet_max


The yeaNay option is used to support a common messaging idiom
where a response to a request is a bool followed by optional
data.  Rather than having two messages like this:
  -out (bool)
  -out (bool,cmw::stringPlus)

, the following can be used:
  -out -yeaNay (bool,cmw::stringPlus)

.  When yeaNay is used, the object(s) after the bool is only
marshalled if the value of the bool is false.  This option
leads to less output from the CMW and smaller executable sizes.

By convention, Middle files have a .mdl suffix.

Don't be confused by the middle tier of the CMW. The middle, back and
front tiers of the CMW use code that's been generated based on Middle files.

Use // to comment out a line of Middle code.
